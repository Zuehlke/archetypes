# FSI Software Engineer Archetype

The FSI Software Engineer represents a domain-specific archetype within Zühlke’s consulting landscape.
It embodies the essential competencies that enable software engineers to thrive in Financial Services Industry (FSI) environments — primarily Banking and Insurance.

FSI engineers are expected to bridge the gap between technology and finance: understanding the business domain, communicating effectively with stakeholders, and making design and implementation decisions that align with client goals and regulatory requirements.

This archetype serves as the foundation for consultants working within FSI Market Units and as a reference point for professional development and staffing readiness.

## Novice

At this level, the goal is to build a shared foundation — to understand the financial and accounting concepts that underpin every FSI system or process.

An engineer at this stage gains awareness of how money, assets, and risk are structured, enabling more meaningful communication with business stakeholders. The emphasis is on grasping fundamentals that will later connect to domain-specific applications in Banking and Insurance.

## Advanced Beginner

Here, the learning shifts from the general to the industry-specific.
You will explore how financial principles manifest differently across Banking and Insurance, learning their structures, products, and key terminology.

This stage focuses on recognizing patterns in FSI solutions — how data models, risk frameworks, and compliance requirements vary between subdomains. The engineer begins to navigate real-world business contexts rather than isolated concepts.

## Competent

At the competent level, engineers gain a comprehensive understanding of the structure and operations of various financial domains.

The focus shifts from general principles to the specific business models, products, and processes that define distinct areas of Banking and Finance — such as Retail Banking, Corporate Banking, Investment Banking, Trading, and Cryptocurrency.

A competent FSI engineer can recognize how these domains function, how value is created and managed, and how financial institutions differentiate their services. This knowledge enables meaningful participation in discussions with domain experts and supports informed decision-making within project contexts.

## Proficient

At the proficient stage, engineers develop a strategic understanding of the FSI environment — connecting technical decisions to regulatory frameworks, compliance standards, and vendor ecosystems.

This level involves interpreting regional regulations, industry standards, and vendor landscapes, enabling engineers to design compliant and scalable solutions across jurisdictions.

Proficient FSI engineers can advise clients, anticipate regulatory implications, and integrate third-party products or APIs into enterprise-grade systems with confidence.
