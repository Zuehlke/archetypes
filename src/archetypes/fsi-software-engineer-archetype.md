title: FSI Software Engineer
description: |
  The FSI Software Engineer represents a domain-specific archetype within Zühlke’s consulting landscape. It embodies the essential competencies that enable software engineers to thrive in Financial Services Industry (FSI) environments — primarily Banking and Insurance.

  FSI engineers are expected to bridge the gap between technology and finance: understanding the business domain, communicating effectively with stakeholders, and making design and implementation decisions that align with client goals and regulatory requirements.

  This archetype serves as the foundation for consultants working within FSI Market Units and as a reference point for professional development and staffing readiness.
