# Introduction

A developer's career rarely follows a single, linear path.
As skills and interests evolve, so too do job titles and aspirations.
So how can we support this variety of career goals while still aligning with the needs of the business?

One approach is to introduce **Career Pathways** and **Archetypes**.

Career Pathways are collaboratively defined by practice leads and senior practitioners.
They include a combination of core capabilities—common to all developers—and optional specialisms that reflect individual focus areas.

Developer Archetypes help describe these specialisms. Examples include: Backend Developer, Frontend Developer, Mobile Developer, DevOps Engineer, Tech Lead, Infrastructure Developer, Data Engineer, Platform Engineer, API Developer, Data Platform Specialist, Application Architect, Systems Architect, Security Architect, AppSec Developer, Account Technical Principal, and Executive Technical Principal — to name just a few.

These archetypes are built on a shared foundation of capabilities and follow a simple Dreyfus-based maturity model, independent of promotion conversations.
One person may span multiple archetypes, reflecting the diversity of modern software roles.

As we continue to refine this model, we'll define an approval structure for Archetypes.
But the key idea remains: a flexible, transparent framework that supports individual growth and evolving business needs.
