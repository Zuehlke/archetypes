# Extreme Programming (XP) Practices

Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile software development methodology emphasising technical excellence and customer satisfaction through reinforcing practices.
Built on simplicity, communication, feedback, courage, and respect, XP takes effective engineering practices to "extreme" levelsâ€”continuous integration happens often daily, pair programming replaces individual development, and customer representatives work directly with the team.
XP embraces change by using short development cycles, incremental planning, and automated testing to deliver high-quality software that evolves with changing requirements.
Rather than viewing change as a threat to project timelines, XP treats it as an inevitable reality and builds processes that harness change to create better products that meet customer needs.
