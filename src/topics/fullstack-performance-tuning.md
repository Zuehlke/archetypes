# Fullstack Performance Tuning

Fullstack performance tuning focuses on optimizing both frontend and backend systems to deliver fast, efficient, and scalable web applications. This topic covers techniques for identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks across the stack.

## Key Concepts

- **Frontend Optimization**: Reducing bundle sizes, lazy loading, and optimizing rendering.
- **Backend Optimization**: Query optimization, caching, and efficient resource management.
- **Database Performance**: Indexing, query tuning, and connection pooling.
- **Monitoring and Profiling**: Using tools to identify performance issues.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Measuring performance across the entire application.
