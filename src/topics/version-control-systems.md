# Version Control Systems

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing developers to track modifications, compare versions, and revert to previous states when needed.
At its core, version control serves as a project's timeline and safety net, enabling collaboration among team members while maintaining a complete history of what changed, when, and by whom.
