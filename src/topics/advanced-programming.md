description: 'Advanced programming builds on core language mastery to tackle complex
  architectural patterns, performance optimization, and sophisticated design approaches.
  This encompasses understanding memory models, concurrency patterns, metaprogramming
  capabilities, and framework internals. Advanced programmers write code that''s not
  just correct but elegant—minimizing complexity, maximizing efficiency, and enabling
  others to build upon their work.
