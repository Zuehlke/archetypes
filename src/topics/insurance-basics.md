# Insurance Basics

Insurance is a financial arrangement that provides protection against potential future losses or damages. It involves the transfer of risk from an individual or entity (the insured) to an insurance company (the insurer) in exchange for regular payments known as premiums. Insurance policies outline the terms and conditions under which the insurer agrees to compensate the insured for covered losses, helping to mitigate financial uncertainty and provide peace of mind.
