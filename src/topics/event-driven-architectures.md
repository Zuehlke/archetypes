# Event-Driven Architectures

Event-driven architectures (EDA) enable systems to react to events asynchronously, improving scalability and responsiveness. This topic introduces EDA concepts, patterns, and tools.

## Key Concepts

- **Event Producers and Consumers**: Understanding the roles in an EDA system.
- **Message Brokers**: Using tools like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS SNS/SQS.
- **Event Sourcing**: Storing the state as a sequence of events.
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation for read/write separation.
- **Error Handling**: Managing failures in distributed systems.
