title: Building for Scale
description: 'Scaling is handling increasing load—more users, data, or transactions.
  Building for scale requires early architectural decisions: monolith vs. microservices,
  caching strategies, database design. This topic covers horizontal/vertical scaling,
  load balancing, caching layers, database optimization, and load testing. Premature
  optimization is anti-pattern, but thoughtless design that can''t scale is equally
  problematic.
