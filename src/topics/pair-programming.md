# Pair Programming

Pair programming is a collaborative software development technique in which two programmers work together at a single workstation to solve the same problem simultaneously.
This approach results in higher code quality, fewer defects, improved team cohesion, and faster skill development.
Although it may seem counterintuitive to managers concerned about productivity, research indicates that the slight increase in development time is often outweighed by significant reductions in debugging and maintenance costs later on.
