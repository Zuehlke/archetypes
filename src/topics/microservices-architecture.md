# Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture involves designing applications as a collection of small, independent services. This topic introduces the principles, benefits, and challenges of microservices.

## Key Concepts

- **Service Decomposition**: Breaking down monoliths into microservices.
- **Communication**: Using REST, gRPC, or messaging systems.
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamically locating services in a distributed system.
- **Data Management**: Handling data consistency and transactions.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Observing and debugging distributed systems.
