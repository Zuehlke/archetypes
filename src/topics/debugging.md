# Debugging

Debugging is a fundamental skill in software engineering, involving the systematic identification, analysis, and resolution of defects in code. Effective debugging requires both technical expertise and analytical thinking to isolate complex issues and implement sustainable solutions. Developers use a variety of tools and techniques, including IDE-integrated debuggers, logging frameworks, automated testing, and root cause analysis. Modern environments such as IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio, VS Code, and PyCharm provide powerful debugging capabilities tailored to these languages.
