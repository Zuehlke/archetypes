# Advanced Microservices Patterns

Advanced microservices patterns focus on solving complex challenges in distributed systems, such as data consistency, fault tolerance, and scalability. This topic introduces advanced design patterns and strategies for microservices.

## Key Concepts

- **Saga Pattern**: Managing distributed transactions.
- **Event Sourcing**: Capturing changes as a sequence of events.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Preventing cascading failures in distributed systems.
- **Service Mesh**: Managing service-to-service communication.
- **Observability**: Implementing logging, tracing, and metrics.
