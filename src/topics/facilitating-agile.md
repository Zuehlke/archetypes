description: 'Facilitating Agile means creating environments where teams can work
  effectively in iterative, adaptive ways. This includes running ceremonies (standups,
  retrospectives, planning), removing blockers, coaching teams through Agile adoption,
  and balancing autonomy with alignment. Facilitators don''t have all answers but
  help teams learn.
