# Backend Frameworks (Spring Boot/.NET Core/Express)

Backend frameworks simplify the development of server-side applications by providing pre-built components and tools. This topic introduces popular frameworks like Spring Boot, .NET Core, and Express.

## Key Concepts

- **Routing**: Defining endpoints and handling requests.
- **Middleware**: Adding functionality to the request-response cycle.
- **Dependency Injection**: Managing dependencies in a modular way.
- **Database Integration**: Connecting to and querying databases.
- **RESTful APIs**: Building APIs using framework-specific tools.
