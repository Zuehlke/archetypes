title: Distributed Systems Theory and Practices
description: >
  Distributed systems span multiple machines and must handle concurrency, failure, and consistency challenges. This topic covers fundamental concepts: CAP theorem, eventual consistency, consensus algorithms, distributed transactions, and failure detection. Understanding these helps design resilient systems and make trade-off decisions.

# Distributed Systems Theory and Practices

*Generated by AI, pending community review.*

Distributed systems span multiple machines and must handle concurrency, failure, and consistency challenges. This topic covers fundamental concepts: CAP theorem, eventual consistency, consensus algorithms, distributed transactions, and failure detection. Understanding these helps design resilient systems and make trade-off decisions.
