title: Distributed Systems Theory and Practices
description: 'Distributed systems span multiple machines and must handle concurrency,
  failure, and consistency challenges. This topic covers fundamental concepts: CAP
  theorem, eventual consistency, consensus algorithms, distributed transactions, and
  failure detection. Understanding these helps design resilient systems and make trade-off
  decisions.
