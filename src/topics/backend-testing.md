- **Integration Testing**: Verifying interactions between modules or services.
- **API Testing**: Ensuring REST or GraphQL APIs behave as expected.
- **Performance Testing**: Measuring the scalability and responsiveness of backend systems.
- **Testing Tools**: Using tools like JUnit, xUnit, Mocha, and Postman.
