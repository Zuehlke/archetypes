  Non-functional requirements (NFRs) define how systems must behave: performance, security, reliability, usability, compliance. Unlike functional requirements ('the system calculates X'), NFRs describe quality attributes ('the system responds in under 100ms'). Explicit NFRs guide architecture and prevent discovering requirements late.

# Non-Functional Requirements

*Generated by AI, pending community review.*

Non-functional requirements (NFRs) define how systems must behave: performance, security, reliability, usability, compliance. Unlike functional requirements ('the system calculates X'), NFRs describe quality attributes ('the system responds in under 100ms'). Explicit NFRs guide architecture and prevent discovering requirements late.
