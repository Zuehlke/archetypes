title: Non-Functional Requirements
description: 'Non-functional requirements (NFRs) define how systems must behave: performance,
  security, reliability, usability, compliance. Unlike functional requirements (''the
  system calculates X''), NFRs describe quality attributes (''the system responds
  in under 100ms''). Explicit NFRs guide architecture and prevent discovering requirements
  late.
