# State Management in Frontend Frameworks

State management is a critical concept in frontend development, enabling predictable and scalable handling of application data. This topic introduces state management techniques and tools commonly used in frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.

## Key Concepts

- **Local State**: Managing state within individual components.
- **Global State**: Sharing state across multiple components.
- **State Management Libraries**: Tools like Redux, MobX, and Zustand.
- **Immutable State Updates**: Ensuring state changes do not mutate the original data.
- **Asynchronous State Management**: Handling API calls and side effects.
