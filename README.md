# Zuhlke Engineering Archetypes and Learning Pathways
[![CC BY-NC-SA 4.0][cc-by-nc-sa-shield]][cc-by-nc-sa]

## Project Overview
This project aims to help software engineers understand the skills and knowledge required at each stage of their career, from novice to expert. It serves as a roadmap for personal and professional development, enabling individuals to identify areas for growth and track their progress.
This is done by using 'archetypes' that define competencies 'topics' expected at different competency stages, as well as 'learning resources' that guide individuals in acquiring these skills.

### Project Structure
The project is structured into several key components:
-  `src/` - This folder contains definition files that outline the archetypes, topics, and learning resources in Markdown format.
    -  `src/archetypes/` - Contains archetype definitions, which describe the competencies and skills expected at various stages of a software engineer's career.
    -  `src/topics/` - Contains definitions of topics that are relevant to the archetypes, detailing the specific skills, knowledge areas and any learning resources associated with them.
    - `src/assets/` - Contains images and other assets used in the documentation.
- `docs/` - A static website generated from these definitions, providing an accessible and user-friendly interface for exploring the archetypes and learning pathways.

## Contributing
